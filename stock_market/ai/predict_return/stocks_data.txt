"stock": the name of the stock
"1_month_return": the return of the stock over the past month
"2_month_return": the return of the stock over the past 2 months
"3_month_return": the return of the stock over the past 3 months
"positive_return": a binary indicator variable that is 1 if the stock had a positive return over the next month, and 0 otherwise
