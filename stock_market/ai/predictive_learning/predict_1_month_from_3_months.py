"""The mean absolute error is a measure of how close the predictions are to the actual values. A low mean absolute error indicates that the model is performing well.

8. **Use the model to make trading decisions.**

Once we have a trained model, we can use it to make trading decisions. For example, we could buy a stock if the model predicts that the stock price will increase in the next month.

It is important to note that stock prices are unpredictable and any trading decisions should be made with caution.
